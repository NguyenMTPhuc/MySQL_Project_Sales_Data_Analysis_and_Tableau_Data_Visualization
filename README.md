# Digital Music Store EDA and Data Visualization Project
This project aims to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization on a dataset from a digital music store, focusing on understanding customer behavior and sales performance. The primary goal is to uncover valuable insights into various aspects of the business, such as identifying top-selling artists, albums, and genres, and analyzing trends in customer purchase behavior.

The analysis explores key factors, including customer demographics, purchase amounts, and product popularity, to identify which music genres, albums, and artists generate the highest revenue. Additionally, it examines sales trends across different regions and countries, providing insights into geographical performance and market preferences. Furthermore, to enhance these insights, Tableau has been utilized to create an interactive dashboard, highlighting significant patterns and offering a clear, visual representation of trends.
